    <p class="page-text">
      Peakora was created from a simple truth. Life feels lighter when we slow down enough to hear ourselves. Most of us move through our days on autopilot, carrying expectations and invisible emotional weight. We forget to pause. We forget to breathe. We forget to check in with the person who matters most. Ourselves.
    </p>

    <p class="page-text">
      Peakora exists to bring you back to that place. A place where you can reconnect with yourself without guilt or pressure. A place that feels human, warm, and gentle.
